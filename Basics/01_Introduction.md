# Computer Networking
Computer networking refers to the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. It involves the design, implementation, and management of networks, allowing devices to communicate and exchange data.

Key components of computer networking include:

1. **Devices**: Computers, servers, routers, switches, and other hardware that connect to a network.
2. **Protocols**: Rules and conventions for communication between devices, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.
3. **Types of Networks**: Local Area Networks (LAN), Wide Area Networks (WAN), and others, each serving different scales and purposes.
4. **Network Architecture**: The layout and structure of the network, including how devices are interconnected.
5. **Security**: Measures to protect the network and data from unauthorized access and threats.

Networking enables various applications, such as file sharing, internet access, and cloud services, making it a crucial aspect of modern computing.
