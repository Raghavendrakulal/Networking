 Let’s go through **a few more detailed examples** of routing in networking. These will include both **LAN (Local Area Network)** and **WAN (Wide Area Network)** scenarios, and will cover **static** and **dynamic** routing too.

## 🖥️ Example 1: Simple Routing in a LAN (Local Area Network)

### 🌐 Network Setup

| Device  | IP Address  | Default Gateway |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| PC1     | 192.168.1.2 | 192.168.1.1     |
| Router  | 192.168.1.1 | N/A             |
| Printer | 192.168.1.3 | 192.168.1.1     |

### ✅ Scenario:

PC1 wants to send a print request to the Printer.

### 🧭 Routing Steps:

1. PC1 checks if the destination IP (`192.168.1.3`) is in the same subnet (`192.168.1.0/24`).
2. Since both devices are in the **same network**, no router is needed.
3. The data is sent **directly** to the printer.

> **No actual routing** is needed here; this is handled by simple LAN switching.

## 🌍 Example 2: Static Routing Between Two Networks

### 🌐 Network Setup

* **Router A** connects to Network A: `192.168.1.0/24`
* **Router B** connects to Network B: `192.168.2.0/24`
* Routers A and B are connected through a cable:

  * Router A: `10.0.0.1/30`
  * Router B: `10.0.0.2/30`

### 🧭 Scenario:

A PC in `192.168.1.0/24` wants to talk to a server in `192.168.2.0/24`.

### 🛠️ Static Routes Setup:

* On **Router A**, we configure:

  ```
  ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2
  ```

* On **Router B**, we configure:

  ```
  ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
  ```

### 🚦 Result:

When the PC sends data to the server:

* The PC forwards the packet to **Router A**.
* Router A checks its routing table and sends it via `10.0.0.2` to **Router B**.
* Router B sends the packet to the server.

## 🌐 Example 3: Dynamic Routing with RIP

### Setup with Three Routers

* **Router A** – Network A: `192.168.1.0/24`
* **Router B** – Network B: `192.168.2.0/24`
* **Router C** – Network C: `192.168.3.0/24`

Routers are connected:

* A ↔ B ↔ C

### 📡 Routing Protocol: RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

Instead of manually entering static routes, each router runs RIP:

```bash
router rip
network 192.168.1.0
network 192.168.2.0
network 192.168.3.0
```

### 💡 What Happens:

* Routers automatically **exchange routing tables** every 30 seconds.
* If a PC in Network A sends data to Network C:

  * Router A forwards it to Router B.
  * Router B forwards it to Router C, based on **learned routes** from RIP.

## 🌐 Example 4: Internet Routing (Real World)

### Scenario:

Your home computer (IP: 192.168.0.10) wants to reach `www.google.com` (IP: 142.250.72.132)

### Routing Path:

1. **Default Gateway**: PC sends data to your home router (192.168.0.1).
2. **ISP Router**: Home router forwards the data to your Internet Service Provider.
3. **Backbone Routers**: ISP routers use **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** to find the best path to Google.
4. **Google Data Center**: Eventually, data reaches Google’s server.
5. **Response Travels Back**: The same or a different route can be used in reverse.

> This kind of **global routing** happens millions of times per second!

## 🧾 Summary Table of Examples

| Example Type           | Routing Method | Network Size     | Notes                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| LAN Device to Device   | No routing     | Small (1 subnet) | Same network, uses MAC addressing |
| Static Routing         | Manual         | Small-Medium     | Good for simple, stable networks  |
| Dynamic Routing (RIP)  | Automatic      | Medium-Large     | Uses routing protocols            |
| Internet Routing (BGP) | Dynamic        | Global           | Used by ISPs and big networks     |
