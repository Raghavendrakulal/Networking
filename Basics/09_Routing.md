### ðŸ“¡ Routing in Networking â€“ Explained with Example

---

### âœ… What is Routing?

**Routing** is the process of **selecting a path** for traffic in a network, or between or across multiple networks.

In simpler terms:
Routing decides **how data travels** from **source to destination** across interconnected networks.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

* **Router**: A network device that performs routing.
* **IP Address**: Logical address assigned to each device in a network.
* **Routing Table**: A set of rules stored in a router that helps determine the best path.
* **Hop**: Each time data passes through a router.

### ðŸ”„ Types of Routing

| Type                | Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static Routing**  | Routes are manually configured.                                         |
| **Dynamic Routing** | Routers automatically adjust paths using protocols like OSPF, BGP, RIP. |

### ðŸ“¦ Example of Routing

#### Scenario:

You want to send a message from your computer (IP: `192.168.1.2`) to a server on the internet (IP: `8.8.8.8`).

#### Steps:

1. **You send a request** to `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS).
2. **Your computer checks the routing table** and sends the data to your local router (`192.168.1.1`).
3. **Router forwards the data** to your ISP (Internet Service Provider).
4. ISP routers examine **routing protocols** (e.g., BGP) to find the best path.
5. Data traverses multiple routers across the internet.
6. Eventually, it **reaches the server** at `8.8.8.8`.
7. Response data travels **back through the same or different path**.

### ðŸ“˜ Routing Table (Simplified Example)

| Destination    | Next Hop         | Interface              |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 192.168.1.0/24 | 0.0.0.0 (direct) | eth0                   |
| 0.0.0.0/0      | 192.168.1.1      | eth0 (default gateway) |

* `0.0.0.0/0` is the **default route** â€” used when no other routes match.

---

### ðŸ§­ Summary

Routing ensures that data packets know **where to go** and **how to get there**, using routers and routing tables.
Without routing, data would never leave its source network.
