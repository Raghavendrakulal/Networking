There are several types of computer networks, each designed for specific purposes and scales. Here are the main types:

### 1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**
- **Description**: A network that connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or building.
- **Characteristics**: High-speed connections, typically using Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Ideal for sharing resources like printers and files.

### 2. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**
- **Description**: A network that covers a broad area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.
- **Characteristics**: Uses leased telecommunication lines and technologies like MPLS or satellite to connect multiple LANs.

### 3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
- **Description**: A network that connects multiple LANs within a specific geographical area, such as a city.
- **Characteristics**: Often used by municipalities or large organizations to connect offices across a city.

### 4. **Personal Area Network (PAN)**
- **Description**: A small network typically used for connecting personal devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, within a range of a few meters.
- **Characteristics**: Often uses Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, suitable for personal device communication.

### 5. **Campus Area Network (CAN)**
- **Description**: A network that connects multiple buildings within a campus, such as a university or business complex.
- **Characteristics**: Larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN, often using fiber optics for high-speed connections.

### 6. **Storage Area Network (SAN)**
- **Description**: A specialized network designed to provide access to consolidated, block-level data storage.
- **Characteristics**: Commonly used in enterprise environments to enhance storage devices' accessibility and management.

### 7. **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**
- **Description**: A secure network that allows users to connect to a private network over the internet.
- **Characteristics**: Encrypts data for privacy and security, commonly used by remote workers to access company resources.

### 8. **Overlay Network**
- **Description**: A network built on top of another network, using its infrastructure to create a virtual network.
- **Characteristics**: Examples include peer-to-peer networks and certain types of VPNs, enabling specific functionalities like content delivery or resource sharing.
